# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of tic tac toe using C#.
With this game I will demonstrate the knowledge of C# I have learned from Code Louisville. I will incorporate different things within the Software Development area in Code Louisville. I will be demonstrating 4 different features into this game to show my learning.

The features I will be adding will be adding a master loop, doing 3 or more unit tests, adding a linq query, and creating a class that will inherit from its parent class.

I will have a game of Tic tac toe that will start as a page with the options to choose two players or player vs computer. After choosing you can select which letter from "X" and "O" you would like to be then start the game. There will be a square with 9 individual squares as a usual tic tac toe game has. After finishing the game depending on if you win or not it will say "You won." "You lost." "__ wins." or "tie."
